# Documentation

OpTiMSoC comes with an ever growing set of documentation, consisting of

* the [User Guide](/docs/user-guide/chap_introduction.html)
* the [Reference Manual](/docs/refman/chap_systemsoftware.html)
* API documentation for the GUI and the host library, which can be built from the sources

## Talks

We regularly present OpTiMSoC and its current status at various conferences
and meetings. If you are looking for a quick introduction and like watching
videos and slides more than reading documentation, you might want to have a
look at one of our talks, some of which were recorded.

All talks are obviously a snapshot of the project state at the time of
presentation, so be aware that some information might have changed in the
meantime.

 * ORCONF 2014 (October 4th 2014): A update to the ORCONF 2013 talk, also 
   including more details about the debug system. A video recording and slides 
   are available, see [the blog post]({% post_url 2014-10-12-orconf2014 %}) for
   details.

 * FOSDEM 2014 (February 2nd 2014): A general introduction to OpTiMSoC, slides
   and a rather high-quality video recording are available. See
   [this blog post]({% post_url 2014-01-03-fosdem %}) for all details.

 * ORCONF 2013 (October 5th 2013): A general introduction into OpTiMSoC with a
   focus on the OpenRISC processor cores. A video recording is available on
   YouTube, see [the blog post]({% post_url 2013-10-30-orconf2013 %}) for
   details.
