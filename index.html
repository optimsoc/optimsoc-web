      <h2>What is OpTiMSoC?</h2>
      <p>OpTiMSoC stands for <em>Open Tiled Manycore System-on-Chip</em>. It is an open-source framework primarily written in Verilog which allows you to build your own manycore System-on-Chip by connecting tiles like processors and memories through a Network-on-Chip. The resulting system can then be simulated on a PC or synthesized for an FPGA. You want to know how a SoC really works by taking a deep look inside? You want to evaluate the benefit of a new hardware accelerator? You want to test algorithms to assign tasks efficiently to different processing cores? OpTiMSoC gets you started!</p>

      <h2>Get started!</h2>
      <p>OpTiMSoC comes with an ever growing documentation as well as a lot of sample code that you can use to get started quickly. Depending on the hardware and software you have available, you can start by running a small existing system on an FPGA or simulating it (with Verilator or ModelSim).</p>
