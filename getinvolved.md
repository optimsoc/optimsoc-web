# Get involved

OpTiMSoC strives to be an open source project, not only by license, but by heart.
We're open to contributions from all sides and try hard to make our processes
as transparent as possible.

suited. Simply register and stay in touch with us:

## File Bug Reports & Enhancements

Our bug reports are handled on github. The repositories are described
[here](/download.html). For each repository you can
report issues so that they can be properly assigned, e.g.,
[here](https://github.com/optimsoc/rtl/issues) for RTL bugs, ideas or
enhancements.

## Contribute

We love to support you in writing some code or documentation. You find
all our code in the [public git repositories on
github](https://github.com/optimsoc). Simply create pull requests from
your git repositories or send patches to our [mailing
list](optimsoc@lists.lrz.de).

If you have any questions, feel free to contact Stefan at
[stefan.wallentowitz@tum.de](mailto:stefan.wallentowitz@tum.de).
