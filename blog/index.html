  <h1>The OpTiMSoC Blog</h1>

<p>In our blog we regularly post about the status of the project, things we figured out while working on it and other things that might come to our mind. Please contact us if you want to share your experience with OpTiMSoC, guest posts are always welcome!</p>


  <h2><a href="/blog/2019/06/16/award.html">OpTiMSoC wins the Eurolab4HPC Open Source Project Award!</a></h2>
  <p class="optimsoc-blog-meta">by Philipp Wagner, posted on 16 June 2019
  <p><p>How exciting!
At the <a href="https://fossi-foundation.org/wosh/">Week of Open Source Hardware (WOSH)</a> in Zürich, OpTiMSoC co-won the <a href="https://www.eurolab4hpc.eu/open-source/call/">Eurolab4HPC Open Source Project Award</a>!
We’re very excited and honored to see the efforts we put into OpTiMSoC being more widely recognized.
Thanks a lot to the sponsors of this award!</p>

  <h2><a href="/blog/2018/12/20/release.html">2018.1 Release: Linux, Debugging, Automation, and Tons of Fixes</a></h2>
  <p class="optimsoc-blog-meta">by Philipp Wagner, posted on 20 December 2018
  <p><p>Woohoo! After more than two years of work and 479 git commits later we are very proud to present the all-new 2018.1 release of OpTiMSoC!
A look at the statistics gives a first impression of how large this release is: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">diffstat</code> tells us about 973 files changed, 133,697 lines inserted and 58,806 lines deleted.
Or in other words, the code size increased by 74,891 lines!
How do those lines of code translate into functionality, you may ask?
Let’s have a closer look.</p>

  <h2><a href="/blog/2018/12/19/linux.html">Linux on OpTiMSoC: How many small steps unlock a whole new world</a></h2>
  <p class="optimsoc-blog-meta">by Philipp Wagner, posted on 19 December 2018
  <p><p>Some projects we take upon ourselves are done quickly: start, do the work, profit.
Others take a bit longer.
And then there are these projects which seem to linger forever in an “almost done” state.
Just one more small thing and we’ll be done.
A small fix here.
An extension to a module there.
A new component elsewhere.
And so it goes on, and on, and on.
For days, for weeks, for years.
Adding Linux support to OpTiMSoC is such a story.
But there’s a happy end: Linux support has finally arrived!</p>

  <h2><a href="/blog/2018/12/18/ci.html">Code with Confidence: OpTiMSoC Always Works!</a></h2>
  <p class="optimsoc-blog-meta">by Philipp Wagner, posted on 18 December 2018
  <p><p>OpTiMSoC is a highly complex system.
If all goes to plan, software, hardware and tooling work together to form a well-integrated SoC (framework).
But as so often, the reality is less gloomy: changing a single line of code anywhere could lead to trouble anywhere else.
Finding out about breakages only weeks of months after the fact makes debugging a nightmare. [1]</p>

  <h2><a href="/blog/2017/09/20/status.html">What's going on at OpTiMSoC?</a></h2>
  <p class="optimsoc-blog-meta">by Philipp Wagner, posted on 20 September 2017
  <p><p>Each year in September or early October the OpTiMSoC team attends <a href="https://orconf.org/">ORConf</a>, and this year was no exception.
In addition to exchanging a lot of ideas with friends and other open source enthusiasts, ORConf presents itself as a good opportunity to reflect on what has happened in OpTiMSoC land over the last year.</p>

  <p class="optimsoc-blog-meta">by Pedro H. Penna, posted on 04 September 2017
  <p><p>Linux was ported to OpTiMSoC during the 2017’s Google Sumer of Code. This blog
post details the work that was accomplished during the project; and as well the work
that was left to be tackled.</p>

  <h2><a href="/blog/2016/09/02/release.html">2016.1 Release: Heart Surgery for FuseSoC and Open SoC Debug</a></h2>
  <p class="optimsoc-blog-meta">by Philipp Wagner, posted on 02 September 2016
  <p><p>It’s OpTiMSoC release time! After a bit over half a year of work, we’re proud to announce our first release in this year, 2016.1.
It comes with many great new features, but two are especially noteworthy: our switch to FuseSoC and the integration of Open SoC Debug.
Both new features strengthen our collaborations with other projects – because sharing is caring!</p>

  <h2><a href="/blog/2015/12/30/release.html">2015.1 Release and Back to Unified Tree</a></h2>
  <p class="optimsoc-blog-meta">by Stefan Wallentowitz, posted on 30 December 2015
  <p><p>Good news first: We have a put out a regular release and we promise to
do this more often. Until now there was not much sense to make
releases, because everything was in a flow and there was not even an
installation package. But this has changed, from now on regular
releases can be found on
<a href="https://github.com/optimsoc/sources/releases">github</a>. The release
numbers are numbered throughout the year (2015.1 on December 30 will
hopefully not happen again..).</p>

  <h2><a href="/blog/2015/05/16/repo.html">Switch to github organization and Google repo</a></h2>
  <p class="optimsoc-blog-meta">by Stefan Wallentowitz, posted on 16 May 2015
  <p><p>A few weeks ago we started cutting out the different parts of OpTiMSoC
from the <a href="https://github.com/tum-lis/optimsoc">original repository</a> to
separate repositories at the <a href="https://github.com/optimsoc/">new
organization</a>. The aim is to structure
it better and have separation of different aspects of OpTiMSoC.</p>

  <h2><a href="/blog/2015/05/12/website.html">Website updates and mailing list</a></h2>
  <p class="optimsoc-blog-meta">by Stefan Wallentowitz, posted on 12 May 2015
  <p><p>Maybe not visible to the outside, but there has been a change in the
website rcently. We have updated the documentation, moved the entire
site to <a href="https://github.com/optimsoc/optimsoc.github.io">github pages</a>
and added some social media buttons to share the website or our blog
posts.</p>

  <h2><a href="/blog/2014/10/12/orconf2014.html">Many New Ideas from ORCONF</a></h2>
  <p class="optimsoc-blog-meta">by Philipp Wagner, posted on 12 October 2014
  <p><p>Every autumn the community around the OpenRISC processor meets somewhere to 
discuss the current status of the project, to exchange ideas with other 
free/open hardware projects, and to discuss future directions. This year the 
<a href="http://orconf.org">OpenRISC Conference “ORCONF”</a> was held at TUM in Munich and 
attracted around 40 people from all over Europe and the US.</p>

  <h2><a href="/blog/2014/07/30/glip.html">Switching Host-Communication to GLIP</a></h2>
  <p class="optimsoc-blog-meta">by Philipp Wagner, posted on 30 July 2014
  <p><p>Since its beginning, OpTiMSoC contained a method for communication between a 
PC and an FPGA board. For the ZTEX 1.15 boards we used the USB 2.0 interface, 
based on the Cypress FX2 chip available on those boards. As we continued the 
development, we realized that this connectivity functionality is not only 
useful in OpTiMSoC, but in other projects as well.</p>

  <h2><a href="/blog/2014/01/03/fosdem.html">OpTiMSoC at FOSDEM</a></h2>
  <p class="optimsoc-blog-meta">by Philipp Wagner, posted on 03 January 2014
  <p><p>It’s official! We are proud to announce that our talk at <a href="http://fosdem.org">FOSDEM</a>
has been accepted. FOSDEM, for those of you who have never heard of it, is one of
the largest Free/Open Source conferences in Europe with a very strong focus on
developers and technology. It is held every year in Brusseles, Belgium. This year it
takes place on February 1st and 2nd.</p>

  <h2><a href="/blog/2013/10/30/orconf2013.html">OpTiMSoC at ORCONF 2013</a></h2>
  <p class="optimsoc-blog-meta">by Philipp Wagner, posted on 30 October 2013
  <p><p>The “brain” in a SoC is its processor; in OpTiMSoC this task falls to a 
the freely available OpenRISC processor. For the second year now the developers
of the OpenRISC processor met in Cambridge, UK for a two-day conference on 
October 5th and 6th to discuss the current status of the project as well as
plans for the future.</p>

</p>

  <h2><a href="/blog/2013/08/27/welcome.html">OpTiMSoC has a new web site!</a></h2>
  <p class="optimsoc-blog-meta">by Philipp Wagner, posted on 27 August 2013
  <p><p>OpTiMSoC is growing rapidly. Most of the time we have our heads deep down into
the internals, chasing large and small bugs, implementing exciting new features
and if it all works, enjoy a beer at night.</p>
