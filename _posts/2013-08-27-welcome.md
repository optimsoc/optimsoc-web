OpTiMSoC is growing rapidly. Most of the time we have our heads deep down into
the internals, chasing large and small bugs, implementing exciting new features
and if it all works, enjoy a beer at night.

Then last weekend I thought about how we present all our work to the
public -- and as you might have guessed, there's some room for improvement.
As a first step we decided to redesign our homepage, giving it more content
to help you understand what OpTiMSoC is, where you can get all the necessary
parts to get started and how you can become part of the OpTiMSoC world.

We hope you like it and please get back to us with any feedback you might have.
