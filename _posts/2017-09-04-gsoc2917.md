Linux was ported to OpTiMSoC during the 2017's Google Sumer of Code. This blog
post details the work that was accomplished during the project; and as well the work
that was left to be tackled.

To port Linux to OpTiMSoC, a new manycore configuration with a Host Tile was designed and
implemented. The Host Tile runs OpenRISC Linux and communicates with
applications running on Computing Tiles via message-passing through the
Network-on-Chip (NoC). Overall, the communication infrastructure is exported to
user-level through standard UNIX file system operations, thereby enabling
user-level applications running on the Host Tile to rely on a high-level
communication abstractions. 

## I. Design

Figure 1 presents and the design overview of this project. A manycore
configuration featuring six tiles is depicted, one host tile and five compute
tiles. The host tile has a UART device attached to it and runs the OpenRISC
port of Linux; whereas compute tiles runs user-level applications bare metal.
Processes running on the Host Tile and user-level applications running on the
Compute Tile communicate with one another via message-passing.

Figure 1: Overview of the target manycore configuration.

The OpenRisc Linux kernel running on the Host Tile features a Network-on-Chip
(NoC) driver on which processes rely to send/receive messages. Operations on
this driver are exported to userland through the standard UNIX system calls for
manipulating files. Code Snippet 1 illustrates how a process running on the
Host Tile send messages based on this abstraction. As a side remark, note that
the user-level application should explicitly build the message header. In
future implementation, the idea is to have a user-level library that does this
job for the application. On the other hand, in Compute Tiles, user-level
applications rely on a baremetal message-passing library to carry out a
communication with other tiles.

```
int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
    int fd;
    const char *devname = "/dev/noc";

    /* Open NoC device. */
    fd = open(devname, O_WRONLY);
    
    /* Write some data. */
    while (int i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
        unsigned dest = 0x8000000;
        unsigned data = 0x0000dead;
        unsigned msg = dest | data;
        write(fd, &msg, sizeof(unsigned));
    }
   
    /* Close NoC device. */
    close(fd);

    return (EXIT_SUCCESS);
}
```

## II. NoC Driver Implementation

In this GSoC Project, I produced two main deliverables to the open-source community. The first one, was to integrate OpenRISC Linux Port into the OpTiMSoC. To do so, I forked the upstream Linux project and added to a device tree source file (DTS) narrowed for OpTiMSoC-based platforms. The kernel uses this file to select which device drivers it should embed into the kernel image, determine how interrupts are wired up and know what is the memory layout. Main changes to this file in respect to the generic DTS file for OpenRISC targets concern the clock frequency, the UART device-driver model, and configuration for the NoC device-driver (Contribution 1).

The second deliverable was to write a Linux device driver for the NoC adapter for OpTiMSoC platforms (Contribution 1). I implemented this device driver as a dynamically loadable module and exported all its operations to userland through file system call interface. I carried the implementation of this driver in two phases. In the first one, I relied on a simulated environment running on QEMU. I modelled a loopback OpTiMSoC NoC device there and relied on it to design and implement a draft version of mine driver (Contribution 3). It is worth mentioning that during this first phase, while designing the interrupt handler of the device-driver itself I fixed a bug in the interrupt system of OpenRISC Linux Port kernel. The patch for this fix got accepted and merged to the upstream Linux Kernel Project (Contribution 4). In the second phase, I moved to the Nexys4 DDR FPGA board where I synthesized a 2x2 system configuration using OpTiMSoC, and validated my driver implementation using unit test programs (Contribution 2). The main routines of the implemented driver are discussed next.

```
/*
 * Opens a NoC endpoint. The device minor number is used to
 * identify the target endpoint to open. Access to an endpoint
 * is exclusive, ie. only one process may use a given endpoint
 * at a time.
 */
int optimsoc_open(struct inode *, struct file *);

/*
 * Releases a NoC endpoint. The device minor number is is used
 * to identify the target  endpoint to release. Underlying
 * resources associated with the endpoint are released.
 */
int optimsoc_release(struct inode, struct file *);

/*
 * Sends messages over an endpoint. The device minor number
 * is used to identify the target endpoint to use on the
 * communication. Sending messages does not block the
 * calling process. The size of messages should be aligned
 * on word size (32 bits). Message headers should be built
 * on user-space.
 */
ssize_t optimsoc_write(struct file *, const char *, size_t, off_t);

/*
 * Receives messages over an endpoint. The device minor
 * number is used to identify the target endpoint to use on
 * the communication. Sending messages blocks the calling
 * process. Flits of a message are buffered in kernel land.
 */
ssize_t optimsoc_read(struct file *, const char *, size_t, off_t);


```

## III. Building the Project

Since the Kernel source tree is not yet integrated into OpTiMSoC Project, this
blog post aims at providing enough information to someone on how to setup Linux
on OpTimSoC.

### Part 1: Setup OpTiMSoC

Follow the upstream online instructions at: https://www.optimsoc.org/docs/master/user_guide/installation.html

**In the end, set the ```OPTIMSOC``` environment variable to point to the
installation location of OpTiMSoC.**

### Part 2: Get Development Tools

To build Linux, you will need a slightly diferent toolchain than the one used to build OpTiMSoC. 

- Musl Toolchain
- Newlib Baremetal Toolchain

```
mkdir -p $HOME/toolchain

cd $HOME/toolchain

wget  https://github.com/openrisc/or1k-gcc/releases/download/or1k-5.4.0-20170218/or1k-elf-5.4.0-20170218.tar.bz2

tar -xjvf or1k-elf-5.4.0-20170218.tar.bz2

wget https://github.com/openrisc/or1k-gcc/releases/download/or1k-5.4.0-20170218/or1k-linux-musl-5.4.0-20170218.tar.bz2

tar -xjvf or1k-linux-musl-5.4.0-20170218.tar.bz2

wget https://github.com/openrisc/or1k-gcc/releases/download/or1k-5.4.0-20170218/or1k-linux-5.4.0-20170218.tar.bz2

tar -xjvf or1k-linux-5.4.0-20170218.tar.bz2
```

### Part 3: Build Unit Tests (Optional)

You can test your Linux build in OpTiMSoC with a simple distributed application:

- **hello-linux:** runs on a host tile on top of Linux and simply sends raw messages to a remote compute tile.
- **hello-baremetal**: runs on a compute tile on baremental, and simply read messages that arrive at the local NoC adapater and print them on the screen.

```
export LIBS=$OPTIMSOC/soc/sw/lib/baremetal/libbaremetal.a

git clone https://github.com/optimsoc/linux-apps $HOME/linux-apps

cd $HOME/linux-apps/

export CC=$HOME/toolchain/or1k-linux-musl/bin/or1k-linux-musl-gcc


$CC hello-linux/hello.c -o hello-linux/hello

export CC=$HOME/toolchain/or1k-elf/bin/or1k-elf-gcc
export CFLAGS=”-I $OPTIMSOC/soc/sw/include/baremetal/”

$CC $CFLAGS hello-baremetal/hello.c -o hello-baremetal/hello $LIBS    
```

### Part 4: Build Linux

Setup toolchain.

```
export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/toolchain/or1k-linux/bin/
export ARCH=openrisc
export CROSS_COMPILE=or1k-linux-
```

(Optional) If you have built unit tests from Step 3, you should copy ```hello-linux``` to the the initramfs directory.

```
mkdir -p $HOME/linux/arch/openrisc/initramfs/
    cp $HOME/linux-apps/hello-linux/hello $HOME/linux/arch/openrisc/initramfs/
```

Clone and build Linux. Note that this is done in three steps: (i) build system configuration; (ii) build dynamic modules; and (iii) build the kernel.

```
git clone https://github.com/optimsoc/linux.git $HOME/linux

cd $HOME/linux

make optimsoc_defconfig
make modules
make
```

## III. Conclusions

During this GSoC project I wrote a Linux NoC driver for OpTiMSoC-based platforms. This driver was implemented as a dynamically loadable module and used standard file system kernel calls to export the message passing of the underlying platform to user space. Besides, during this project, I found a bug on the interrupt system of the OpenRISC Linux port and I submitted  a patch to the upstream project.

During this project I learned several lessons. First, I had the opportunity to get in touch with the main maintainers of the OpenRISC project. This will definitely have a very positive impact on the preparation of my PhD thesis, during the upcoming years. Second, I learned a lot about QEMU and Linux projects, so that now I’m able to make more effective contributions to these great open-source projects. Finally, I also learned about FPGA prototyping and debugging, which will also handful during my PhD. In what concerns the main challenges that I faced, I would enumerate (a) get known about the structure and organization of the project that I worked on (QEMU, Linux and OpTiMSoC) and (b) efficiently perform hardware debugging. Therefore. based on all my experience, for the GSoC Project (which I’m strongly considering to apply), I would propose a project that would not involve that many number of open-source projects, so that I could stay more focused and thus be more effective.

Concerning the OpTiMSoC NoC device driver that I implemented, the following work remains open for future enthusiasts:

- **[Enhancement] Enable Endpoints to Be Multiplexed.** In the current implementation, only process at a time may use a given endpoint. A nice feature to have would be to enable multiple processes to concurrently use an endpoint.
- **[Bug Fix] Properly Install the Interrupt Handler.** In the current implementation, when the interrupt handler is registered, the boot sequence halts when running on Verilator/FPGA. Interrupt-firing behavior should be investigated and the interrupt handler setup should be fixed accordingly.
