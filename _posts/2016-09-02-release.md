We are happy to announce that today we release a new version of
OpTiMSoC. It took quite a while to do the 2016.1 release, but finally
we got it together. This time we didn't change the project structure
entirely, but the essential changes are:

 - We have switched to [*FuseSoC*](https://github.com/olofk/fusesoc)
   as our build infrastructure. We still ship our own version
   (`optimsoc-fusesoc`), but this is mainly because we are using the
   new `<vendor>:<library>:<name>:<version>` (vlnv) that we prototyped
   before it is now also getting into upstream. Beside that, we added
   Vivado and better xsim support, that we will also get into the
   official fusesoc version soon.

 - We have switched our debug infrastructure to the
   [*Open SoC Debug*](http://opensocdebug.org) project. We essentially
   started it by cutting out the debug infrastructure concepts from
   OpTiMSoC and now use it also in the [lowRISC](http://lowrisc.org)
   project.

 - Support for *FPGA synthesis* and prebuilt example FPGA bitstreams are
   available again. We currently focus on the
   [Nexys 4 DDR](http://store.digilentinc.com/nexys-4-ddr-artix-7-fpga-trainer-board-recommended-for-ece-curriculum/)
   and the
   [KC705](https://www.xilinx.com/products/boards-and-kits/ek-k7-kc705-g.html)
   boards. But as we have defined a good board abstraction layer now,
   it is a lot easier to support other boards. Please get in
   [touch with us](/getinvolved.html) if you want to have another
   board mainline supported.

There is a tutorial that provides you a quick start as part of our
[user guide](/docs).

We currently plan a project sprint and
[plan the next release](https://github.com/optimsoc/sources/milestone/3)
for end of October with the following improvements:

- Re-activation of the *Partitioned Global Address Space* option

- Support for the KC705

- Improved *Network-on-Chip configuration* for better extendability

- Re-activation of the *multiple clock domains* support and maybe
  dynamic clocks

We are looking forward to your feedback!
