It's official! We are proud to announce that our talk at [FOSDEM](http://fosdem.org)
has been accepted. FOSDEM, for those of you who have never heard of it, is one of
the largest Free/Open Source conferences in Europe with a very strong focus on
developers and technology. It is held every year in Brusseles, Belgium. This year it
takes place on February 1st and 2nd.

Since we don't expect the whole audience to be very deep into hardware design we
will first give a short introduction of how SoC design is done these days, and then
showcase some cool things you can do with OpTiMSoC. More information about the talk
is available at the
[conference homepage](https://fosdem.org/2014/schedule/event/optimisoc/).

I will be attending the whole conference, let me know if you're around. I'd love to
hear from you if you have problems with OpTiMSoC or ideas on how to make it better.
See you at FOSDEM!

__Update:__ The nice people at FOSDEM also published a short interview with me about the
talk.
