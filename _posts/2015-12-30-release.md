Good news first: We have a put out a regular release and we promise to
do this more often. Until now there was not much sense to make
releases, because everything was in a flow and there was not even an
installation package. But this has changed, from now on regular
releases can be found on
[github](https://github.com/optimsoc/sources/releases). The release
numbers are numbered throughout the year (2015.1 on December 30 will
hopefully not happen again..).

We have also accordingly updated the [download
instruction](/download.html), pretty simple now, right?

Now to the kind of "bad" news: We are moving back from Google repo to
a unified source tree, plus extra repositories for demo apps, FPGA
target code, etc. It simply turned out that for people new to git, the
usage of repo is too challenging and time-consuming. Hence, you can
now find the unified source tree
[github](https://github.com/optimsoc/sources). We have brought in all
changes from the distributed repos again.

But to turn it into good news again, you can install from sources with
one simple installer script (a better one to come in 2016):

    git clone https://github.com/optimsoc/sources optimsoc-sources
    ./optimsoc-sources/tools/install.py -d /opt/optimsoc/current

We are looking forward to a more active 2016 and wish you all a Happy
New Year!
