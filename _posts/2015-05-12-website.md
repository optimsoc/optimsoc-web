Maybe not visible to the outside, but there has been a change in the
website rcently. We have updated the documentation, moved the entire
site to [github pages](https://github.com/optimsoc/optimsoc.github.io)
and added some social media buttons to share the website or our blog
posts.

Also very important to mention we want to (re-)activate the mailing
list (optimsoc@lists.lrz.de). So if you have any feedback, questions
or ideas please feel free to send a mail there. You can also subsribe
to the list and always stay updated:

<form class="form-inline" method="post" action="https://lists.lrz.de/mailman/subscribe/optimsoc">
  <div class="form-group">
    <label class="sr-only" for="email">e-mail address</label>
    <input type="text" class="form-control" placeholder="your-email@example.com" name="email" />
  </div>
  <button class="btn btn-primary" type="submit">Subscribe me!</button>
</form>

As you might have noticed, we are also preparing a release, this time
seriously ;)
