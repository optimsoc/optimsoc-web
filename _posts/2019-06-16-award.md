How exciting!
At the [Week of Open Source Hardware (WOSH)](https://fossi-foundation.org/wosh/) in ZÃ¼rich, OpTiMSoC co-won the [Eurolab4HPC Open Source Project Award](https://www.eurolab4hpc.eu/open-source/call/)!
We're very excited and honored to see the efforts we put into OpTiMSoC being more widely recognized.
Thanks a lot to the sponsors of this award!

The other prices went to [Nyuzi](http://nyuzi.org/), a processor for highly parallel and GPGPU applications, and [FuseSoC](https://fusesoc.net/), a hardware package manager and build tool which we use in OpTiMSoC!

You can find OpTiMSoC, Nyuzi, FuseSoC, and many other great projects, listed at the [Open Source contributions page](https://www.eurolab4hpc.eu/open-source/).
