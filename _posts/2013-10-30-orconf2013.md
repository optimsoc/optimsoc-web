The "brain" in a SoC is its processor; in OpTiMSoC this task falls to a 
the freely available OpenRISC processor. For the second year now the developers
of the OpenRISC processor met in Cambridge, UK for a two-day conference on 
October 5th and 6th to discuss the current status of the project as well as
plans for the future.

Stefan attended this conference and came home with a lot of new ideas and 
information, which we'll incorporate into OpTiMSoC in the future. But he was
also able to give a 45 minute presentation about OpTiMSoC, what it is, and how
you can make use of it. The whole talk was recorded, you can watch it down
below or on [YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEf7EFahvAQ). Enjoy!
