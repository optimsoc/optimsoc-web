Every autumn the community around the OpenRISC processor meets somewhere to 
discuss the current status of the project, to exchange ideas with other 
free/open hardware projects, and to discuss future directions. This year the 
[OpenRISC Conference "ORCONF"](http://orconf.org) was held at TUM in Munich and 
attracted around 40 people from all over Europe and the US.

The OpenRISC processor implementation "mor1kx" powers the the OpTiMSoC compute 
tiles, and we have been active in its development for some time now. So it was 
an easy call to make when the question of where to host the next conference 
came up: visit us in Munich!

What followed was a great weekend with many interesting talks. Olof started 
off with a status update on OpenRISC in general, followed by talks presenting 
the changes to the individual components of the OpenRISC project, such as 
toolchain and various porting efforts, e.g. of the Linux Kernel. How OpenRISC 
is used in the wild was shown by reports from research groups all over Europe, 
which are using the OpenRISC architecture as base of their SoC designs. 

Implementing OpenRISC in JavaScript? Why not, thought Sebastian Macke a couple 
years ago, and out of this idea the [jor1k](http://s-macke.github.io/jor1k/) 
emulator was born. In addition to some demos he showed us what's necessary to 
implement a fast (80 MIPS on an iPad!) emulator in JavaScript.

The round of talks was completed by presentations of exciting 
upcoming topics such as the [RISC-V ISA](http://riscv.org/) with its 
implementation, [Rocket](http://riscv.org/download.html#tab_rocket), the 
[lowRISC](http://www.lowrisc.org/) project with the goal of building silicon in 
an open way, and various other topics related to free/open hardware design.

Thanks to everybody who joined us for the conference, and thanks for making 
OpenRISC a success!
